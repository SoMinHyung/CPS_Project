,,,,"I programmed one of our company¡¯s IoT devices, its network interface to be more specific, essentially an UART-Ethernet bridge, which implements the cloud connection and abstracts it all away to some really simple JSON strings. About this guy, I feel confident, no question. I also oversee a great deal of the security questions at the company. Some of you may think this is something mythical with advanced math or something, cause for sure it¡¯s not about reading the wordpress infosec blog about the latest shit. It really isn¡¯t, it¡¯s more like a bit of whiteboarding and a bit of clear thinking. Most vulnerabilities, in my experience, arise from sloppy/bad logic, and some arise from bad implementation of a good logic ? cause the right tools are there, almost guaranteed. Or just ignorance plus business decisions, see below.
For example: I probably couldn¡¯t convincingly explain an ssl/tls crypto handshake at a whiteboard, but I know it¡¯s the right tool, and that I will never ever implement it myself, it comes with a library ? hopefully thoroughly tested by its vendor. Embedded devices are likely to come with dedicated hardware to do cryptography, otherwise the algorithms are painfully expensive for a modest device. A privilege escalation, however, I demonstrated in one of our products when I arrived to the project (still in prototype phase), just by observing its network traffic, without the source code. After the demonstrated attack, it got rewritten. I feel pretty confident about this one too.
What I feel worried about are the half hour time zone ¡°programmers¡± many companies have a tendency to outsource to. Whenever I hear the name of a certain subcontinent tied to a project, I take a step back. While it is fairly easy to find idiot programmers almost everywhere, at least in Romania the industry standard is that we do a fair to good job, cause a great many of us are very competent, some of our universities are for real (some are not, I went to a real one), and the self taught programmers we have are wizards, cause we chose to be in IT, we like doing it, it¡¯s not the socio-economical pressure. On the subcontinent however, the industry standard is working cheap as dirt, for western money, without knowing, and so it seems, without being able to grasp anything beyond some shitty php/js framework¡¯s crud operations. You get what you pay for, huh? Big O notation? Yes we do sir. Scalability? Yes sir, two weeks sir, we implement no problem.
An even more simple case, leading me to worry: management orders to omit security because¡¦ time and money. So stuff go plain text, admin:admin, ports stay open and pervs touch themselves in murky places while viewing the babycam live feed.
The human factor. Especially combined with a short term business model. I feel really worried about humans that joke around in the industry."
,,,,"It depends what type of IOT you mean. For example, if you attach a temperature sensor to a Raspberry Pi without encryption then your data might be intercepted and manipulated. This is particularly relevant if using a local to capture temperature and a remote web site for controlling say a domestic heating system. If instead you use the pi for capture and control then you introduce a single point of failure issue which in turn could cause the home heating system to fail
A possible solution is to use ESP8266 devices in duplicate for data capture and a secure Web IOT service for control. By installing Tasmota on the ESP8266 you can easily configure many sensors without coding. Furthermore, Tasmota permits you to set up an encrypted Mqtt client which can connect through Ssl to AWS IOT. There you can use AWS lambda to build the workflow for a control system. The other advantage of using Tasmota is that you don't need an extra gateway in your home. The only downside is that there is a fairly learning curve for the AWS bits and it is not free. However, it is worth persevering with this."
,,,,"This is quite involved topic, one of the best compilation of the key properties necessary for IoT security was published by Microsoft Research few years back. This is based on their experience in being the target and analyzing all the attack vectors in the cloud, PC and on their Xbox hardware. On the transport side, use of TLS 1.2 has minimized the threat and cloud infrastructure has many protection mechanisms particularly for platform services. The weak area is usually the device itself."
,,,,"How do I feel about IoT and their security you ask. I will say that I am very technical and have been working with electronics since the 70s. Had a TV/VCR repair business in the late 80s and a computer repair business for 15 years starting in the mid 90s. I test several smartphones every year, mostly for curiosity but I also sold them for 5 years. I buy them regularly for the fun of it and pass them to friends and family when I'm done with them. So again I am very intrigued with electronics. Now, about IoT and their security, I have none, I don't want then, and I could care less about them. It isn't because of what they can do and the easement of what they could bring someone but the vulnerability they could cause and if they loose their markers support they become utterly useless shortly after. This has happened in past IoT devices. Company goes bankrupt and all the time and money spent on their products is money wasted. Google has a graveyard or products they have made they they just gave up on and left people who used those products having to look for something else and so have several companies that make IoT device."
,,,,"While IoT or Internet of Things is quickly becoming the new norm, the threats attached to it have also been increasing ever since. Have you heard about the Smart DoorBell provided by Amazon? This doorbell records your images and video is controlled through Wifi and automatically unlocks your door based on the data. While this device may be really convenient to use and provides usable utility, however, the device had succumbed to hackers¡¯ manipulation. Some hackers were able to add their own pictures in the doorbell and unlock it for criminal purposes. So, before we decide upon relying on IoT, we should make sure that we have taken the necessary security measures."
