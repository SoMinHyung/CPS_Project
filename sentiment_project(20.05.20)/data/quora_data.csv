10 Security Principles For IoT Developers:
1. Security vs Convenience
We as human beings always try to balance between convenience and security. A soldier with heavy body armour would be slow on a battlefield but invulnerable to most attacks. Bare minimum armour would give more mobility but might tear apart at the slightest hit of shrapnel. More convenience leads to lesser security. The first and foremost principle IoT developers should follow is to not compromise on security for the sake of convenience.
Cyber Security
70% of IoT devices are open to attacks and Global IoT Security spend is expected to reach $840 million by 2020 according to Gartner Report.
"So, why IoT security is so critical ?"
"Well, There are critical vulnerabilities and security loopholes found in IoT solutions which could be leveraged by hackers to carry out number of criminal activities, including monitoring live feeds, changing device settings and authorizing other users to remotely view and control devices."
Good question! It‚Äôs necessary that security problems are addressed immediately when experimenting with new technologies (especially in a business setting). My team recently wrote a blog specifically addressing IoT and the security challenges that come with it. Here‚Äôs a look into what they wrote‚Ä¶
Companies May Need to Pave the Way to Better Security Standards IoT
Before directly going to the Approaches in IoT Security I will prefer to explain you from the start.
"So what do you mean by IoT ? Many of you I know are known to this term, and yes you are correct full form for it is Internet of things. But when I ask you what you mean by IoT that time my concern goes for meaning and not the full form."
Ofcource for me too it was for the first as Internet of thing !! Thats what we know but knowing partial things sometime is keeeping us away from its impact as well as importance.
"As the IoT industry grows, so do the security issues. As the connected devices, applications and systems grow, so do the security problems that arise. So let us take a closer look at the industry and the Security issues it faces."
IoT Security Issues
Full article: The Problem with Internet of Things You Don't Think About
"In a few years‚Äô time, you will wake up in a world where almost every device you interact with is equipped with some kind of a ‚Äúsense‚Äù. But there is a price for giving devices the ability to communicate with the outer world, namely potential security vulnerabilities."
Need of Security for IoT
I would not explain why IoT security is critical as many people have already answered that. For a quick read you can refer Major Challenges in Implementing IoT Security or 5 Major Security Challenges while Implementing IoT Applications.
There are various approaches to the IoT security which I would like to brief some of them below:
New approaches in IoT Security 
"Last month I went to buy a new AC for my bedroom. After enquiring my budget and few other things, the salesman told me, ‚ÄúYour busy schedule deserves a smart AC only.‚Äù"
This smart AC by LG provides the user with a mobile app through which you can control your AC. This is the just the beginning of IoT in my individual life. So internet of things applications Has Large Area Of Digital Life.
How To JailBreak iOS 9
"The proliferation of IoT and digitization into our day to day life, everyone and everything will become a potential target in the coming future. Introducing IoT into general household goods such as watches, mobile devices, television, kitchen appliances etc. The rate at which the technology is growing combined with the widely-reported insecurity of IoT devices, it is masquerading towards a whole new frontier for ransomware operators. Eventually increasing cybersecurity threat landscape."
Internet of things or IoT is possibly the next step in the evolution of the internet. IoT refers to the hundreds of physical devices that are connected to exchange data with each other over a network.
So what is the importance of IoT security Compliance ?

Security Basics- Fundamentals
There are 5 major components of IoT:
Security and privacy are considered essential components and must be added to this list of components.
IoT security has been introduced to the industry and is used in various ways:
Architecture
The security architecture comprises of four fundamental layers for security analysis:
2020 will be a year of steady evolution for IoT security.
"As the market continues to expand, companies will invest more into enforcing the entire paradigm: from making security by design a fundamental engineering practice to implementing security features at all other levels and, most importantly, educating end users about effective methods of protecting their homes and businesses from prying eyes and data leaks."
Notable IoT security trends in 2020:
Instance-based Video Retrieval
Retrieve video centrally from IGZY cloud platform from anywhere at any time.
Restrict Access
"With OTP-based locks, employee access can be restricted into areas like vaults, locker rooms, etc."
E-Guarding
"Cost of hiring night guards for ATMs and Bank branches is reduced to minimal, as E-Guarding allows for little or no human intervention for security management, even at odd hours."
Alerts & Notifications
Concerned authorities and officials are automatically notified in real-time in case of a breach.

"The new effective approach in IoT security that first comes to my mind is, of course, planning security from the beginning of your project."
"Specifically, these are the recommended measures:"
IoT security has been questionable since the inception of the technology. As the technology became a race to provide the most innovative solutions rather than protective. Although now this is changing. There are techniques like applying cognitive technologies over your IoT network to obtain real-time threat data as well. Know here to understand IoT security better

"The link will direct you to Ilantus, a company I am currently working with"
"‚ÄúThe ease with which hackers can exploit security vulnerabilities in these cheap and plentiful [IoT] devices is disturbing,‚Äù writes PivotNine Chief Analyst Justin Warren. IoT vendors are not interested in security or the expenses involved in protecting data, whether it‚Äôs business or consumer. They are interested in ease-of-use, cost of distribution, and time-to-market."
"Until the regulatory climate surrounding IoT devices matures, this will not change. There is currently no liability for vendors and manufacturers. There is no reason for most of them to care about cybersecurity."
the latest approach in IoT security calls for the use of solutions that are already install within the enterprise and use these to discover and monitor IoT devices. SentinelOne Ranger is one such example- it utilizes existing SW agents installed on endpoints to monitor network traffic and identify rogue devices:

"As per there is not so much rules and regulations regarding the IoT Security, so there are no so much new approaches to secure the IoT Devices and network."
Still there are some points that you may consider -
"For more information or for the security of your IoT Devices, you can contact Kratikal Tech. Pvt. Ltd.. They are among the few Cyber Security Companies who deal with the security of IoT Devices."
"As we know IoT is not technology it's a system of systems - and as we know it's all about Internet when it's comes to IoT : Here, security comes to the picture."

"The world of IoT cyber threats is ever evolving. I think all approaches should adopt the notion that security is a continuous effort, rather than a one-time mission during the system design. Therefore, the most advanced approaches are the ones that adopt adaptive security, as the expiration date of a secure design is the moment hackers manage to bypass it. I found some of the approach described in this blog post interesting: The Illusion of Security By Design. I hope you find it interesting as well."

Increasing cyber-attack and rising awareness related to data security and privacy among enterprise and individual is restraining growth of global internet of thing (IOT) market.
"The wide proliferation of IoT technologies has made smart devices a new ‚Äî and often easy ‚Äî target for hackers. 2020 will be a year of steady evolution for IoT security. As the market continues to expand, companies will invest more into enforcing the entire paradigm."
Here are just a few notable directions to get a general idea where the research and the whole industry is moving:
"The Internet of Things security crisis has persisted for decades, producing a seemingly endless stream of under-secured consumer gadgets, corporate phones, printers, networking equipment, medical devices, and critical infrastructure sensors and controllers. By now, every industry has an IoT albatross around its neck. And though new devices are increasingly equipped with basic security protections, those minimum standards are just the beginning."
"Internet of things is the system of interrelated computing devices, mechanical and digital machines provided with unique identifiers and the ability to transfer data over a network without requiring human to human or human to computer interaction."
"IoT has the potential to impact traditional business processes in banking such as KYC, lending, collateral management, trade finance, payments, PFM, and insurance. Coupled with other emerging technologies, such as digital identity and smart contacts, IoT can create new P2P business models that have the potential to disrupt banking in a few areas."
"The main objective of IoT security is to preserve privacy, confidentiality, ensure the security of the users, infrastructures, data, and devices of the IoT, and guarantee the availability of the services offered by an IoT ecosystem."
"Most answers define three layers or spheres for the IoT, being the edge, the gateway and the cloud.  I like how you've split out hub and gateway, so I'll use the four, and break it down further at the edge.  Likewise, I'm going to answer the entire question, rather than just the bit you've called out, and, only at the very end once I've supplied the context for my answer, will I answer.  If you're all tl;dr, scroll down to the bold, italic statement and read from there."
Edge:  Sensors and Actuators(which talk to)Hubs(which talk to)Gateways(which talk to)The cloud/Enterprise
"It won‚Äôt be good but I‚Äôve to say that IoT has quite low/minimal security standards till now, actually there is none and there are multiple reasons to say so."
"Though there are some ways using which you can secure your IoT devices - As everyone said, one is by using protocols like MQTT over SSL.Plus encrypt and authenticate the data transmission and device and always change the default SSH keys."
You got the point :-) at the moment IoT suffer of a lack in security standard.Basically they rely on protocol standards implementation for security data transportation (see bluethooth standard encryption as well as wifi 802.11).
"Of course, it depends by what kind of device you have to connect: Arduino has small cpu power than an edison, but far more that a wearable device). However, at the moment, I haven't seen any security implementation on top of the transportation layer. But if someone knows something more, please add info."
"While most of the answers here talk about using SSL/TLS along with out-of-the-box security features of the radio technology, there is a recent trend of ensuring security and identity right from the chip level. Here are some news:Secure processors matter in IoT applications"
ARM unveils 2 secure processors for the Internet of Things

"So all the major chip vendors are taking steps toward this direction. With on-board cryptography, these processors promise better security from ground up."

‚Ä¢ Web/Cloud services
‚Ä¢ Mobile applications
"‚Ä¢ Identity management, authentication, authorization, access control"
‚Ä¢ Privacy
"Amazon IoT uses MQTT, which needs to be encrypted using SSL or TLS. They have documentation on how to emulate the device using a software client:"
Verify MQTT Subscribe and Publish
"OpenSSL and mbedTLS enjoy early support from CPU manufacturers like ARM, and are supported by Amazon IoT."
Internet of Things: Ingenious Technology of the Connected World
"As anyone with a TV or PC probably knows, the Internet of Things is a network that allows the ‚ÄúThings‚Äù to communicate to each other without need of human intervention. Prior to emergence of the IoT, the internet connected devices require humans to generate or consume information. Some examples of internet connected personal devices are smartphones, laptops, and desktops."
"Despite increased calls for more regulation and standardization , there aren‚Äôt any real industry- wide security standards. New initiatives such as the ITTF proposed Standard for IoT Firmware Updates"
and the ENISA suggested framework for device security .
Recently Industrial Internet Consortium has released IoT Security Maturity Model which would be helpful in adopting the right IoT Security strategies.

"What's an IoT security vulnerability? Most people think this would be an easy question to answer, but in fact it turns out not to be."
"It may not be obvious at first why it's worth devoting several pages to discussing the meaning of the term. After all, it‚Äôs possible to look up both ""security"" and ""vulnerability"" in a dictionary and come to a reasonable understanding of what it means."
"IoT devices are really just like any computers; they have some hardware, which runs an OS, which runs some software to perform the function provided by the ‚Äúthing.‚Äù In fact many, many IoT devices are just running embedded versions of Linux or similar OSs, kind of like an Android phone does but with a smaller footprint and tuned to perform just the needed functions."
"Any time you put Internet-connected stuff out without a) first making sure your code is as secure as possible, b) making sure you have a way to provide software patches, and c) having a risk remediation plan in place, you‚Äôre asking for trouble."
"These devices are literally computers. There‚Äôs always something that can be remotely exploited. In the most recent cases, they were unwittingly joined to massive botnets to target websites for ransom or just malice (krebsonsecurity, for example because he pissed some whiny little shits off by talking about their criminal enterprise)."
"Vulnerabilities in IoT devices come due to various reasons like ‚Äì lack of security updates, or from web applications that are insecure, or from insecure services authentication. IoT security vulnerabilities can occur due to exposing insecure services to the internet. They can occur if insecure networks are used for communication. It is found that IoT devices are bringing new security threats to home network security."
Many factors really :
"They come from device makers not doing their bit to secure the devices, and from users who are unaware and fail to conduct even the simplest security measures."
Hey plz check my article on minimizing risks in IoT App Development.
"I have always made it a point to go through the flaws of technology first rather than focusing on its so-called valuable benefits. Internet of things received a widespread hype for its implementation scope. At the beginning of the year, 2015 many experts claimed it is going to be an existential year for IoT. We also made a statement on how this year is going to be the year for IoT Enterprise segment. However sluggish growth and poor development owing to IoT security have resulted in doubts."
The Security Challenge for IoT
"Despite being considered a game changer, Internet of Things (IoT) is fraught with serious security issues"
To be simple and crisp the major advantages of using IoT enabled security cameras over the non-IoT ones are as follows
"Nice doubt, to make you understand everything I have included an article in detail here. Find some time to check it out."
"IoT is short for Internet of Things. The Internet of Things refers to the ever-growing network of physical objects that feature an IP address for internet connectivity, and the communication that occurs between these objects and other Internet-enabled devices and systems."
IoT Extends Internet Connectivity
"When talking about major players in IoT security, the first thing we should point out is that the IoT security world is wide and full of different approaches (like the cybersecurity world in general). Interestingly, the approaches are not contradicting each other - the most secured IoT device would probably have all of the solutions working together to protect him."
Here are the leading IoT security approaches and the major players promoting them:
"IoT vendors are not interested in security or the expenses involved in protecting data, whether it‚Äôs business or consumer. They are interested in ease-of-use, cost of distribution, and time-to-market."
"Until the regulatory climate surrounding IoT devices matures, this will not change. There is currently no liability for vendors and manufacturers. There is no reason for most of them to care about cybersecurity."

"‚ÄúThere is an old song which asserts 'the best things in life are free.' Not true! Utterly false! This was the tragic fallacy which brought on the decadence and collapse of the democracies of the twentieth century; those noble experiments failed because the people had been led to believe that they could simply vote for whatever they wanted...and get it without toil, without sweat, without tears. Nothing of value is free. Even the breath of life is purchased at birth only through gasping effort and pain.‚Äù - Robert Anson Heinlein"

"IoT security is a largely unregulated space as of now, and there is lack of standardized solutions. Though a lot has been progressed in the field over past couple of decades, yet there are many unresolved solutions. Hence there are enormous possibilities of research in this area."
1. Managing technology & innovation
"‚ÄúManagement of innovation and technology is of particular importance right now,‚Äù says Sabatier. ‚ÄúQuestions about R&D, strategy and business models, and innovation are very important both from a theoretical and managerial point of view.‚Äù"
2. Resources management & sustainable development
"Energy management, water management, and sustainable development are all identified among ‚Äúthe great ‚Äòmacro‚Äô themes of the century‚Äù by Alessandro Binachi, DBA program thesis and research coordinator at European University‚Äôs Business School in Spain."
3. Social entrepreneurship
"The Internet of Things (IoT) is already causing huge shifts in how organizations spend money on technology. IDC estimates that over the period from 2015 to 2020, more than $1 trillion‚Äîyes, trillion with a t‚Äîwill be invested in the IoT market, with industrial applications accounting for the largest share of that growth. And where investment flows, jobs follow: It's estimated that the IoT industry will support between 1 and 2 million technical employees."
"Hi there,"
Good to see that you are interested in IoT security in an early stage of your career.
"Since you are currently in university, I would recommend you to start NOW and focus on learning skills in IoT Security and applying it to build something."
"To get started in IoT security, here‚Äôs what you need to do:"
Harvard based Experfy has an IoT Security Course taught by two IoT experts.
"The course provides the steps needed to design and implement an IoT Security Program. Learn from the Authors of ""Practical Internet of Things Security‚Äù."
"Experfy also offers an Introduction to the Internet of Things (IoT)- a fast paced course for anyone who wants to understand what is Internet of Things. Understand how IoT evolves from the Internet, what the core technologies and systems are and how it is implemented."
Great question!
The best resource is to do an course where you will learn all the techniques in IoT security. You have to choose the best course and choosing one with such limitations in the field is hard. The best course in my opinion is the Offensive IoT Exploitation course.
"Future Market Insights forecasts revenue from the global IoT security product market to increase from US$ 12 Bn in 2017 to about US$ 48 Bn by 2027 end, representing a CAGR of 14.9% from 2017 to 2027. This increasing revenue growth is attributed to continuous launching of IoT security offerings and emergence of niche players in the market. Moreover, an increasing number of service providers is also supporting revenue growth of this market."

"Today both IoT and Big Data markets see rapid growth and development, affecting almost all life spheres and business industries. The future is promising to be impressive: Internet-connected devices everywhere, smart electrical grids, smart homes, smart cars, even smart cities;"
"automated processes, reduced costs, advanced customer data, increased customer loyalty, boosted sales, improved marketing, enhanced business strategy development, predictive analysis."
The original question has multiple interpretations; is this about DIY projects one could try? or currently available products? or perhaps more futuristic visions to be implemented in the next decade?
"Let me tackle the second option: commercial products that are being used today or in the immediate future. I will divide the projects into the consumer smart home space (Amazon Echo, Belkin Echo Water), retail space (dynamic pricing, and beacons), smart city (selective waste collection and smart meters plus demand-response platforms) and lastly industrial systems (predictive maintenance)"
Central to the issue of IoT security going forward is the increasing requirement for security and networking groups to communicate.
Network operators are satisfied if all the network packets are moving fast with high availability and low latency even if all those packets are giving malicious traffic.
"The network plays a vital role in two sections: recognizing when an attack is using the place and returning to the attack by shutting down the device, limiting it, or slowing it down."
"In many cases, the network that you use is essential to IoT security as it can be a point of access for external threats."
"IoT devices that are collecting data for your business must use a network (although it doesn‚Äôt have to be public!) to send the data to the cloud, leaving it potentially vulnerable."
"Because of this, it‚Äôs important that businesses choose IoT connectivity types that are secure so that their information can‚Äôt be compromised."
"We all know that IoT has managed to connect our devices everywhere - from our fitness trackers to our vehicles and appliances. While it offers a wide range of opportunities for manufacturers and consumers, it also poses major risks in terms of security and privacy."
"Machine learning is a technology which can be use in wide variety operations. It can be use to eliminate human and human errors, can make more quick data analytics for quick fast and better operations or in performance of Artificial Intelligence (the outcome of which one can‚Äôt even imagined some times.)"
Block chain is authentic entry only ledger system where you can only enter a transaction entry and can never modify it and all this happen with network consensus and so eliminate cracking a single node and thus provide secure ledger entry.
"Don‚Äôt upload keys to the repo, they can change each time you install the service."
"Don‚Äôt use Id,s to enable or disable user‚Äôs sessions use tokens. If you use the user‚Äôs id you end disabling the user."
So:
user <=> token/session(stored at device) <=> system.
When the user access you send a token to the device. Now you can disable the device so it can‚Äôt access the APIs.
"That is the developer side. On the client side many people is careless -8th layer error-, allow other people to use the same devices, or networks. Or download malware or whatever. You can‚Äôt protect that side."

How do you feel about IoT or IoT security?
"I programmed one of our company‚Äôs IoT devices, its network interface to be more specific, essentially an UART-Ethernet bridge, which implements the cloud connection and abstracts it all away to some really simple JSON strings. About this guy, I feel confident, no question."
ML and IOT security are definitely more in demand than reverse engineering.
"Wait, what?"
"It's a button, how would you hijack it? I assume you mean by randomly or intentionally overclickling?"
"The dash button is still linked to your Amazon account, so any malfunction would be picked up on your account. Then you throw the button away."
"There are other fail-safes in place. You may not order the same thing within a 24 hour period and because it's connected to your app, you get a chance to cancel any purchases that may have been initiated in error."
"Interesting question - any device is vulnerable to botnets and being used for DDoS attacks. I would be less worried about your Dash button getting DDoSed and more concerned about it getting infected by something like Mirai and becoming part of a botnet. You‚Äôre not likely to connect it to the network in such a way that it should get infected, but that‚Äôs the biggest risk."
There also Mirai scanners and other scanners that you can identify vulnerable devices so it might pick up the IP address of your dash. Best bet is to hack your dash to update the firmware but that‚Äôs not feasible.
I don't know what you mean by best. Financially? Contributions to humanity?
"IoT security is probably a hardware problem as much as anything, although in the abstract upper levels there will be problems too. Generally though, the reasons this has been addressed have been pretty gimmicky so far."
"Machine learning is an old friend, deep learning is kind of a subset of that now. My contention is that all of these subjects are super broad, and require very different skill sets depending on what aspects of them are pursued."

"Growing number of devices connected to each other via IoT has resulted in increasing vulnerability in terms of security of the entire IoT ecosystem. Increasing intensity of cyber-attacks on IoT networks and devices has prompted solution providers to focus more on security aspects, which is driving market demand for IoT security solutions globally."
"I have worked for three different home security companies: Protect America, Guardian Protection Services, and Frontpoint Security. I was responsible for Business Development (lead generation, affiliate marketing, partnership marketing, etc.) and my programs generated more than 75,000 new residential customers."
Over the years I have marketed and competed against the largest and fastest growing security companies in the US. I learned early on that there is not much difference between any of these companies when you really boil it down. SimpliSafe is no exception.
"I switched to SimpliSafe four years ago. The installation was easy - took me 30 minutes to setup the system (base station + 8 sensors). In the first year there were a couple of false alarms, but other than that it just works. We actually had a burglary attempt and the system handled it pretty well - alarm went off and the monitoring center called me (and the cops) immediately. It was a minor incident, but I do think the alarm helped scare the burglar away and minimize the damage."
"Overall, I love SimpliSafe."
"Well.. so as part of the hype around blockchain there is lots of discussion of iot and blockchain.. in which blockchain's majickal properties will be brought to bear on the challenges of provenance, privacy, and commercialisation of iot data. Most is this chatter is mindless nonsense, spouted by people who u derstand neither iot nor blockchain"
The key issues are..
"Security of the device itself‚Ä¶ from hacking, reverse engineering, and hijacking"
"Security of the data in flight, ensuring that is isn't tampered with or spoofed as it travels from the decision to the host"
5 IoT networking security mistakes
"According to a 2018 report from Symantec, IoT devices have experienced a whopping 600% increase in cyber-attacks year-over-year. It‚Äôs not too surprise, though‚Äîhardware and software flaws have contributed to the proliferation of enterprise security incidents. That said, human error should not be overlooked."
"In a recent article for Network World, Robert Burnett, Brother‚Äôs director of B2B products and solutions, summarized the five most common networking mistakes that companies make which lead to being open to malicious activity."
There are a whole bunch of certifications available from industry leaders.
In addition there are lots of free resources and tutorials for IOT without certifications

IoT vs CPS:  I  would see the difference of Thing vs System
"CPS - Cyber Physical Systems. We can refer to an System which comprises of Embedded System, Sensory components and capability to communicate over a network. Probably CPS could have multiple sub-system with in it."
Whoa lot of research is required in this area my thoughts organized by order:
"Hello,"
"Even though there are not a lot of IoT security certifications at the moment, it could be tough to choose the right one."
"The Offensive IoT Exploitation security training course certification has landed people roles with higher pay packages, landed them as an IoT security researcher and pentester for their organization, and even created the new generation of IoT developers who know IoT security issues in and out."
Experfy is a Harvard-incubated marketplace for training and consulting. You might want to check out the Securing Enterprise Internet of Things Implementations course. This course should be of interest to all IT professionals and security engineers responsible for architecting and implementing new IoT-based capabilities within an enterprise. This course will provide the steps required to design and implement an IoT Security Program.

It‚Äôs no secret that the miracle of the Internet of Things (IoT) has ushered in a new way in which we do business on the day to day lives. And like any technological advancement that comes. It also comes with it with a superfluity of security threats that seem to impede its growth. And the internet of things is not an exemption to this.
"Today, analysts expect IoT revolution in many life spheres and business industries. According to recent predictions, by 2020 there will be over 26 billion connected devices worldwide!"
"The future is promising to be impressive: connected devices everywhere, smart electrical grids, smart homes, smart cars, and even smart cities."
"Unfortunately, now anything, from smart devices to consumer electronics and networks, can be hacked. Understanding possible risks and establishing safeguards take the center stage: 92% of companies using IoT solutions are highly concerned about IoT security issues."
What an interesting question. The IoT regulatory and legal landscape is definitely changing. You can read more about in in this article: IoT security laws and standards you must know and get ready to adhere to
"All the security aspects of your internet and cloud computing remains same in IoT at the ""internet"" level.But, there is a urgent need in implementing security on the ""things"" level. And by this, i mean, implementing ""efficient"" security on a microcontroller level. There are a lot of challenges on doing it, and people are working on it to give an efficient solution. you can look into ""security"" at the ""embedded"" or ""device"" level."
"You can start by going through ""Network security"" or ""cryptography"" subjects to get an idea on how to implement security. Take up a microcontroller (i would suggest an arduino dev. board) and start implementing the concepts on it."
"Yes, there will be enormous scope. Information World is about IoT these days and security takes up the centrestage"
IoT security brings numerous security support in the protection of small businesses.
"There are going to be 20 billion IoT devices by 2020, as per Gartner. Advances in IoT continue to deliver the dreams of science fiction today."
It will not surprise if all of these IoT innovations speak to each other and learn from each other to manage a myriad of business functions.
"However, with more digital entry points to your business, it's vital to consider cybersecurity as part of your office upgrades."
"IoT devices are physical objects embedded with sensors. They are connected to an IT network to communicate with other devices and software applications such as mobile phone apps, desktops, printers, and other office/home appliances."
"So any IoT security attack can cost businesses millions of dollars or even force one to shut down. As per Symantec, IoT attacks increased 600 percent between 2016 and 2017."
"Small businesses must prioritize IoT security as it may increase the security vulnerability to cyber risks, like DDoS attacks, which can stall your whole business."
"Hence, this emerging technology is expected to become mainstream.Connected Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices are hackable. Hence, business is vulnerable if a personal or work-related IoT device is on your internal network."
"So, moot question is how to keep your business safe?"
"Typically, one can protect their businesses by following the same precautions with smart devices as they use for securing their websites."
Prime is to understand your business risk.
Revisit security issues that threaten your primary network connected to all your stakeholders.
"Evaluate the requirement of each device that is getting added to the business network. Ask, is it needed?"
Reevaluate the security options and take the necessary measure to secure all the devices.
"While setting up a device, avoid using default settings, change the default password, and set robust password protocols (using upper and lowercase letters, numerals, and symbols)."
Enable password lockout and encryption (if these features are supported).
¬∑ Utilize three separate networks on-premises.
¬∑ First is your internal network (primary) for all business-related devices.
"¬∑ Second, a customer/guest network (secondary) for any non-employees who wish to connect when they‚Äôre on-site."
"¬∑ Third, a separate IoT network for employees‚Äô non-work devices, comprising their smartphones, streaming tools, and any other equipment they bring to work."
This way attacker can be drastically limited to the device accessibility (to be hacked) and unable to reach any official business devices.
The implementation of a secure solution in a segmented IoT network of the business will require an updated and publicized BYOD policy. It is to be laid out what devices should connect to which system. What kind of utilization is permitted on the respective network? It must be forbidden to connect a personal device to the internal network until there is an authorized business reason for doing so.
"Lastly, security standards for personal devices on the network must be established. In case the device can use some authentication measure like a PIN, password, etc., it should be activated, deploying privacy and security controls."
"Though the opportunities created by the IoT are new propelling businesses to continuously develop new ways to connect, however, in a rush, security often takes a backseat. Companies must bring more awareness of this threat and pushing further to address the issue and should Stop exposing the business to unnecessary risk."
"The worldwide IoT security market size is required to reach USD 9.88 billion by 2025, as per another new study by Grand View Research, Inc., advancing at a CAGR of 29.7% during the figure time frame."
"Due to increasing smart city projects, the adoption of sensor applications is rising significantly. A growing number of connected devices is expected to fuel demand for IoT security in North America. For instance, the U.S. government invested US$ 8.8 Bn in 2015 in IoT for infrastructure, software and cyber security solutions."
"Yep, security is mostly an after-thought when shipping IoT devices."
